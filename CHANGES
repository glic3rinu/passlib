**1.5.3** (2011-10-08)
======================

    Bugfix release -- fixes BCrypt padding/verification issue

    .. _bcrypt-padding-issue:

    This release fixes a single issue with Passlib's BCrypt support: Many
    BCrypt hashes generated by Passlib (<= 1.5.2) will not successfully verify
    under some of the other BCrypt implementations, such as OpenBSD's
    ``/etc/master.passwd``.

    *In detail:*    

        BCrypt hashes contain 4 "padding" bits in the encoded salt, and Passlib
        (<= 1.5.2) generated salts in a manner which frequently set some of the
        padding bits to 1.  While Passlib ignores these bits, many BCrypt
        implementations perform password verification in a way will reject
        *all* passwords, if any of the padding bits are set.  Thus Passlib's
        BCrypt salt generation needed to be corrected to ensure compatibility,
        and a route provided to fix existing hashes already out in the wild
        [issue 25].
        
    *Changes in this release:*
    
    .. currentmodule:: passlib.context
      
    * BCrypt hashes generated by Passlib now have all padding bits cleared.
    
    * Passlib will continue to accept BCrypt hashes that have padding bits
      set, but when it encounters them, it will issue a :exc:`UserWarning`
      recommending that the hash should be fixed (see below).
      
    * Applications which use :meth:`CryptContext.verify_and_update` will
      have any such hashes automatically re-encoded the next time the user
      logs in.

    *To fix existing hashes:*
    
        If you have BCrypt hashes which might have their padding bits set,
        you can import :class:`!passlib.hash.bcrypt`, and
        call ``clean_hash = bcrypt.normhash(hash)``.
        This function will clear the padding bits of any BCrypt hashes,
        and should leave all other strings alone.

**1.5.2** (2011-09-19)
======================

    Minor bugfix release -- mainly Django-related fixes

    Hashes

        .. currentmodule:: passlib.hash

        * *bugfix:* :class:`django_des_crypt` now accepts all
          :mod:`Hash64 <passlib.utils.h64>` characters in it's salts;
          previously it accepted only lower-case hexidecimal characters [issue 22].

        * Additional unittests added for all
          standard :doc:`Django hashes </lib/passlib.hash.django_std>`.

        * :class:`django_des_crypt` now rejects hashes where salt and checksum
          containing mismatched salt characters.

    CryptContext

        .. currentmodule:: passlib.context

        * *bugfix:* fixed exception in :meth:`CryptPolicy.iter_config`
          that occurred when iterating over deprecation options.

        * Added documentation for the (mistakenly undocumented)
          :meth:`CryptContext.verify_and_update` method.

**1.5.1** (2011-08-17)
======================

    Minor bugfix release -- now compatible with Google App Engine.

    * *bugfix:* make ``passlib.hash.__loader__`` attribute writable -
      needed by Google App Engine (GAE) [issue 19].

    * *bugfix:* provide fallback for loading ``passlib/default.cfg``
      if :mod:`pkg_resources` is not present, such as for GAE [issue 19].

    * *bugfix:* fixed error thrown by CryptContext.verify
      when issuing min_verify_time warning [issue 17].

    * removed min_verify_time setting from custom_app_context,
      min_verify_time is too host & load dependant to be hardcoded [issue 17].

    * under GAE, disable all unittests which require writing to filesystem.

    * more unittest coverage for :mod:`passlib.apps` and :mod:`passlib.hosts`.

    * improved version datestamps in build script.

**1.5** (2011-07-11)
====================

    *"20% more unicode than the leading breakfast cereal"*

    The main new feature in this release is that
    Passlib now supports Python 3 (via the 2to3 tool).
    Everything has been recoded to have better separation
    between unicode and bytes, and to use unicode internally
    where possible.
    When run under Python 2, Passlib 1.5 attempts
    to provide the same behavior as Passlib 1.4;
    but when run under Python 3, most functions
    will return unicode instead of ascii bytes.

    Besides this major change, there have
    been some other additions:

    Hashes

        * added support for Cryptacular's PBKDF2 format.
        * added support for the FSHP family of hashes.
        * added support for using BCryptor as BCrypt backend.
        * added support for all of Django's hash formats.

    CryptContext

        .. currentmodule:: passlib.context

        * interpolation deprecation:

          :meth:`CryptPolicy.from_path` and :meth:`CryptPolicy.from_string`
          now use :class:`!SafeConfigParser` instead of :class:`!ConfigParser`.
          This may cause some existing config files containing unescaped ``%``
          to result in errors; Passlib 1.5 will demote these to warnings,
          but any extant config files should be updated,
          as the errors will be fatal in Passlib 1.6.

        * added encoding keyword to :class:`!CryptPolicy`'s
          :meth:`!.from_path()`, :meth:`!.from_string`,
          and :meth:`!.to_string` methods.

        * both classes in :mod:`passlib.apache`
          now support specifying an encoding for the username/realm.

    Documentation

        * Password Hash API expanded to include explicit
          :ref:`unicode vs bytes policy <hash-unicode-behavior>`.
        * Added quickstart guide to documentation.
        * Various minor improvements.

    Internals

        * Added more handler utility functions to reduce code duplication.
        * Expanded kdf helpers in :mod:`passlib.utils.pbkdf2`.
        * Removed deprecated parts of :mod:`passlib.utils.handlers`.
        * Various minor changes to
          :class:`passlib.utils.handlers.HasManyBackends`;
          main change is that multi-backend handlers now raise
          :exc:`~passlib.utils.MissingBackendError`
          if no backends are available.

    Other

        * Builtin tests now use :mod:`!unittest2` if available.
        * Setup script no longer requires distribute or setuptools.
        * added (undocumented, experimental) Django app
          for overriding Django's default hash format,
          see ``docs/lib/passlib.ext.django.rst`` for more.

**1.4** (2011-05-04)
====================

    This release contains a large number of changes, both large and small.
    It adds a number of PBKDF2-based schemes, better support
    for LDAP-format hashes, improved documentation,
    and faster load times. In detail...

    Hashes

        * added LDAP ``{CRYPT}`` support for all hashes
          known to be supported by OS crypt()
        * added 3 custom PBKDF2 schemes for general use,
          as well as 3 LDAP-compatible versions.
        * added support for Dwayne Litzenberger's PBKDF2 scheme.
        * added support for Grub2's PBKDF2 hash scheme.
        * added support for Atlassian's PBKDF2 password hash
        * added support for all hashes used by the Roundup Issue Tracker
        * bsdi_crypt, sha1_crypt now check for OS crypt() support
        * ``salt_size`` keyword added to encrypt() method of all
          the hashes which support variable-length salts.
        * security fix: disabled unix_fallback's "wildcard password" support
          unless explicitly enabled by user.

    CryptContext

        * host_context now dynamically detects which formats
          OS crypt() supports, instead of guessing based on sys.platform.
        * added predefined context for Roundup Issue Tracker database.
        * added CryptContext.verify_and_update() convience method,
          to make it easier to perform both operations at once.
        * *bugfix:* fixed NameError in category+min_verify_time border case
        * apps & hosts modules now use new
          :class:`LazyCryptContext` wrapper class -
          this should speed up initial import,
          and reduce memory by not loading uneeded hashes.

    Documentation

        * greatly expanded documentation on how to use CryptContexts.
        * roughly documented framework for writing & testing
          custom password handlers.
        * various minor improvements.

    Internals

        * added generate_password() convenience method
        * refactored framework for building hash handlers,
          using new mixin-based system.
        * deprecated old handler framework - will remove in 1.5
        * deprecated list_to_bytes & bytes_to_list - not used, will remove in 1.5

    Other

        * password hash api - as part of cleaning up optional attributes
          specification, renamed a number of them to reduce ambiguity:

            - renamed *{xxx}_salt_chars* attributes -> *xxx_salt_size*
            - renamed *salt_charset* -> *salt_chars*
            - old attributes still present, but deprecated - will remove in 1.5

        * password hash api - tightened specifications for salt & rounds parameters,
          added support for hashes w/ no max salt size.

        * improved password hash api conformance tests

        * PyPy compatibility
