Release History
===============

**DEV BRANCH**
    
    This development branch contains a pure-python implementation
    of the scrypt kdf primitive (passlib/utils/_slow_scrypt.py).
    It's currently of interest as a curiosity only,
    and may never be fast enough to be useful (in which case
    this branch may be closed).

**1.6** (NOT YET RELEASED)

    Hashes

        * The :doc:`bcrypt <lib/passlib.hash.bcrypt>` class now supports
          crypt_blowfish's ``$2y$`` hash prefix (though it will not generate
          them by default).

        * The *unix_fallback* handler has been deprecated, and will be removed
          in Passlib 1.8. Please use the improved replacement,
          :doc:`unix_disabled <lib/passlib.hash.unix_disabled>`,
          instead.

        * Added support for Window's Domain Cached Credentials (aka
          "dcc", "mscache", "mscash"), versions 1 and 2:
          :doc:`msdcc <lib/passlib.hash.msdcc>` and
          :doc:`msdcc2 <lib/passlib.hash.msdcc2>`.

        * The rarely-used hash previously known as ``nthash`` has been renamed to
          :class:`~passlib.hash.bsd_nthash`, to better indicate it's lineage;
          a new :class:`~passlib.hash.nthash` class now directly implements
          the plain hexidecimal Windows NT password hash.

        * added support for Windows' :doc:`lmhash <lib/passlib.hash.lmhash>`
          (aka Lan Manager password hash).

        * added support for Cisco :doc:`PIX <lib/passlib.hash.cisco_pix>` and
          :doc:`Type 7 <lib/passlib.hash.cisco_type7>` password hashes.
          (Cisco Type 5 passwords seem to be the same as
          :doc:`md5_crypt <lib/passlib.hash.md5_crypt>`).

        * added support for MS SQL Server password hashes (
          :doc:`mssql2000 <lib/passlib.hash.mssql2000>` and
          :doc:`mssql2005 <lib/passlib.hash.mssql2005>`).

        * Passlib now offers the :doc:`scram <lib/passlib.hash.scram>` hash,
          specially designed for storing digest information for verifying
          a user against the SCRAM protocol (:rfc:`5802`). It can also
          be used to verify users in the same way as any other password
          hash in Passlib, though it offers no particular advantages
          outside of this special case.

        * Fixed rare ``'NoneType' object has no attribute 'decode'`` error
          that sometimes occurred on platforms with a deviant implementation
          of :func:`!os_crypt`.

        * The :doc:`ldap salted digests </lib/passlib.hash.ldap_std>`
          now support salts from 4-16 bytes [issue 30].

        * :class:`bsdi_crypt` now issues a warning if an even number of rounds
          is requested by the application, due to a known weakness in DES.

        * All hashes will now throw :exc:`~passlib.exc.PasswordSizeError`
          if the provided password is larger than 4096 characters.

          This limit should be above any reasonable password size,
          and prevents various things including DOS abuse of hashes
          that have an expensive password-length-dependant stage,
          and for OS's which have a buggy :func:`!crypt.crypt` implementation.

    CryptContext

        .. currentmodule:: passlib.context

        * :class:`~CryptContext` now supports a :ref:`passprep <passprep>` option,
          which can be used to run all passwords through SASLPrep (:rfc:`4013`),
          in order to normalize their unicode representation before hashing
          [issue 24].

        * The :class:`!CryptContext` option
          :ref:`min_verify_time <min-verify-time>` has been deprecated,
          will be ignored in release 1.7, and will be removed in release 1.8.

        * The internals of :class:`!CryptContext` have been rewritten
          drastically. It's methods should now be stricter and more informative
          about invalid values; and common :class:`!CryptContext` operations
          should be faster, and have shorter internal code paths.

        * The :attr:`!CryptContext.policy` attr, and the supporting
          :class:`!CryptPolicy` class, have been deprecated in their entirety.

          They will not be removed until Passlib 1.8, to give applications
          which used these features time to migrate. Applications which did
          not use either of these features explicitly should be unaffected by
          this change.

          The functionality of :class:`!CryptPolicy` has been merged
          into the :class:`CryptContext` class, in order to simplify
          the exposed interface. Information on migrating can be found
          in the :class:`CryptPolicy` documentation, as well as in
          the :exc:`DeprecationWarning` messages issued when a :class:`!CryptPolicy`
          is invoked.

        * :meth:`CryptContext.from_path` and :meth:`CryptContext.from_string`
          (and the legacy :class:`CryptPolicy` object) now use stdlib's
          :class:`!SafeConfigParser`.

          Previous releases used the original :class:`!ConfigParser` interpolation.
          Passlib 1.5 switched to :class:`SafeConfigParser`,
          but kept support for the old format as a (deprecated) fallback.
          This fallback has been removed in 1.6; any
          legacy config files may need to double any raw ``%`` characters
          in order to load successfully.

    Utils

        .. currentmodule:: passlib.utils.handlers

        * Internal handler framework (:mod:`passlib.utils.handlers`) rewritten
          drastically. Provides stricter input checking, reduction in
          boilerplate code.

        * :class:`~passlib.utils.handlers.GenericHandler` and related mixins
          changed in backward-incompatible way: the ``strict`` keyword
          was removed. :class:`!GenericHandler` now defaults to a behavior
          which matches ``strict=True``: the constructor strictly requires
          all values be specified, and that all values be within correct bounds.
          The new keywords ``use_defaults`` and ``relaxed`` can be used
          to disable these two requirements, respectively.

        * :class:`~passlib.utils.handlers.StaticHandler` now derived from
          :class:`!GenericHandler`, and required ``_calc_checksum()`` be
          implemented instead of ``encrypt()``.

        * :class:`~passlib.utils.handlers.GenericHandler` and related mixins
          changed in backward-incompatible way: the :samp:`norm_{xxx}`
          classmethods have been renamed to :samp:`_norm_{xxx}`, and turned
          into instance methods. Similar renames were done for
          ``calc_calchecksum`` and ``generate_salt``.

        * Calls to :meth:`HasManyBackends.set_backend`
          should now use the string ``"any"`` instead of the value ``None``.
          ``None`` was deprecated in release 1.5, and is no longer supported.
          This affects all schemes in :mod:`passlib.hash` which support
          multiple backends.

        .. currentmodule:: passlib.utils

        * :mod:`!passlib.utils.h64` has been replaced by an instance of the
          new :class:`~passlib.utils.Base64Engine` class. This  instance is
          imported under the same name, and has (mostly) the same interface;
          but should be faster, more flexible, and better unit-tested.

        * deprecated some unused functions in :mod:`!passlib.utils`,
          they will be removed in release 1.7.

    Other

        * The api for the :mod:`passlib.apache` module has been updated
          to add more flexibility, and to fix some ambiguous method
          and keyword names. The old names are still supported, but deprecated,
          and will be removed in Passlib 1.8.

        * Handle platform-specific error strings returned by :func:`!crypt.crypt`.

        * Passlib is now source-compatible with Python 2.5+ and Python 3,
          and no longer requires the use of :command:`2to3` to run under Python 3.

        * Hash unittest framework rewritten. More border cases handled,
          some simple fuzz testing added.

        .. currentmodule:: passlib.hash

        .. _consteq-issue:

        * All digest comparisons within Passlib are now done using
          a "constant time" comparison function :func:`~passlib.utils.consteq`,
          instead of ``==``.

          *In detail:*

              This change is motivated by an `hmac timing attack <http://rdist.root.org/2009/05/28/timing-attack-in-google-keyczar-library/>`_
              which exploits ``==``'s short-circuit comparison algorithm.
              This attack is generally not applicable to password hashes,
              as it requires the attacker to both know the salt,
              and be able to generate digests beginning with a specific prefix.
              However, while this task should be computationally difficult
              against modern hashes (such as :class:`sha512_crypt`), this
              change should pre-emptively protect Passlib in case someone
              constructs a such an attack in the future. Furthermore, some of
              the legacy hashes supported by Passlib (such as
              :class:`mysql323`) are already weak enough to be vulnerable.

        * Builtin implementations of :class:`md5_crypt`,
          :class:`sha256_crypt`, and :class:`sha512_crypt` sped up by
          about 25% due via additional pre-computation step.

        * Restored builtin pure-python BCrypt implementation
          (:mod:`passlib.utils._slow_bcrypt`) that was removed in v1.3.
          This implementation is still *WAY* to slow to be suitable
          for production. However, it's almost fast enough under PyPy,
          and might be sped up in the future... so while it is disabled
          by default, developers who really want to use it
          should set the environment variable ``PASSLIB_BUILTIN_BCRYPT=enabled``
          before loading Passlib.

**1.5.3** (2011-10-08)
======================

    Bugfix release -- fixes BCrypt padding/verification issue

    .. _bcrypt-padding-issue:

    This release fixes a single issue with Passlib's BCrypt support: Many
    BCrypt hashes generated by Passlib (<= 1.5.2) will not successfully verify
    under some of the other BCrypt implementations, such as OpenBSD's
    ``/etc/master.passwd``.

    *In detail:*

        BCrypt hashes contain 4 "padding" bits in the encoded salt, and Passlib
        (<= 1.5.2) generated salts in a manner which frequently set some of the
        padding bits to 1.  While Passlib ignores these bits, many BCrypt
        implementations perform password verification in a way which rejects
        *all* passwords if any of the padding bits are set.  Thus Passlib's
        BCrypt salt generation needed to be fixed to ensure compatibility,
        and a route provided to correct existing hashes already out in the wild
        [issue 25].

    *Changes in this release:*

    .. currentmodule:: passlib.context

    * BCrypt hashes generated by Passlib now have all padding bits cleared.

    * Passlib will continue to accept BCrypt hashes that have padding bits
      set, but when it encounters them, it will issue a :exc:`UserWarning`
      recommending that the hash should be fixed (see below).

    * Applications which use :meth:`CryptContext.verify_and_update` will
      have any such hashes automatically re-encoded the next time the user
      logs in.

    *To fix existing hashes:*

        If you have BCrypt hashes which might have their padding bits set,
        you can import :class:`!passlib.hash.bcrypt`, and
        call ``clean_hash = bcrypt.normhash(hash)``.
        This function will clear the padding bits of any BCrypt hashes,
        and should leave all other strings alone.

**1.5.2** (2011-09-19)
======================

    Minor bugfix release -- mainly Django-related fixes

    Hashes

        .. currentmodule:: passlib.hash

        * *bugfix:* :class:`django_des_crypt` now accepts all
          :data:`hash64 <passlib.utils.h64>` characters in it's salts;
          previously it accepted only lower-case hexidecimal characters [issue 22].

        * Additional unittests added for all
          standard :doc:`Django hashes </lib/passlib.hash.django_std>`.

        * :class:`django_des_crypt` now rejects hashes where salt and checksum
          containing mismatched salt characters.

    CryptContext

        .. currentmodule:: passlib.context

        * *bugfix:* fixed exception in :meth:`CryptPolicy.iter_config`
          that occurred when iterating over deprecation options.

        * Added documentation for the (mistakenly undocumented)
          :meth:`CryptContext.verify_and_update` method.

**1.5.1** (2011-08-17)
======================

    Minor bugfix release -- now compatible with Google App Engine.

    * *bugfix:* make ``passlib.hash.__loader__`` attribute writable -
      needed by Google App Engine (GAE) [issue 19].

    * *bugfix:* provide fallback for loading ``passlib/default.cfg``
      if :mod:`pkg_resources` is not present, such as for GAE [issue 19].

    * *bugfix:* fixed error thrown by CryptContext.verify
      when issuing min_verify_time warning [issue 17].

    * removed min_verify_time setting from custom_app_context,
      min_verify_time is too host & load dependant to be hardcoded [issue 17].

    * under GAE, disable all unittests which require writing to filesystem.

    * more unittest coverage for :mod:`passlib.apps` and :mod:`passlib.hosts`.

    * improved version datestamps in build script.

**1.5** (2011-07-11)
====================

    *"20% more unicode than the leading breakfast cereal"*

    The main new feature in this release is that
    Passlib now supports Python 3 (via the 2to3 tool).
    Everything has been recoded to have better separation
    between unicode and bytes, and to use unicode internally
    where possible.
    When run under Python 2, Passlib 1.5 attempts
    to provide the same behavior as Passlib 1.4;
    but when run under Python 3, most functions
    will return unicode instead of ascii bytes.

    Besides this major change, there have
    been some other additions:

    Hashes

        * added support for Cryptacular's PBKDF2 format.
        * added support for the FSHP family of hashes.
        * added support for using BCryptor as BCrypt backend.
        * added support for all of Django's hash formats.

    CryptContext

        .. currentmodule:: passlib.context

        * interpolation deprecation:

          :meth:`CryptPolicy.from_path` and :meth:`CryptPolicy.from_string`
          now use :class:`!SafeConfigParser` instead of :class:`!ConfigParser`.
          This may cause some existing config files containing unescaped ``%``
          to result in errors; Passlib 1.5 will demote these to warnings,
          but any extant config files should be updated,
          as the errors will be fatal in Passlib 1.6.

        * added encoding keyword to :class:`!CryptPolicy`'s
          :meth:`!.from_path()`, :meth:`!.from_string`,
          and :meth:`!.to_string` methods.

        * both classes in :mod:`passlib.apache`
          now support specifying an encoding for the username/realm.

    Documentation

        * Password Hash API expanded to include explicit
          :ref:`unicode vs bytes policy <hash-unicode-behavior>`.
        * Added quickstart guide to documentation.
        * Various minor improvements.

    Internals

        * Added more handler utility functions to reduce code duplication.
        * Expanded kdf helpers in :mod:`passlib.utils.pbkdf2`.
        * Removed deprecated parts of :mod:`passlib.utils.handlers`.
        * Various minor changes to
          :class:`passlib.utils.handlers.HasManyBackends`;
          main change is that multi-backend handlers now raise
          :exc:`~passlib.exc.MissingBackendError`
          if no backends are available.

    Other

        * Builtin tests now use :mod:`!unittest2` if available.
        * Setup script no longer requires distribute or setuptools.
        * added (undocumented, experimental) Django app
          for overriding Django's default hash format,
          see ``docs/lib/passlib.ext.django.rst`` for more.

**1.4** (2011-05-04)
====================

    This release contains a large number of changes, both large and small.
    It adds a number of PBKDF2-based schemes, better support
    for LDAP-format hashes, improved documentation,
    and faster load times. In detail...

    Hashes

        * added LDAP ``{CRYPT}`` support for all hashes
          known to be supported by OS crypt()
        * added 3 custom PBKDF2 schemes for general use,
          as well as 3 LDAP-compatible versions.
        * added support for Dwayne Litzenberger's PBKDF2 scheme.
        * added support for Grub2's PBKDF2 hash scheme.
        * added support for Atlassian's PBKDF2 password hash
        * added support for all hashes used by the Roundup Issue Tracker
        * bsdi_crypt, sha1_crypt now check for OS crypt() support
        * ``salt_size`` keyword added to encrypt() method of all
          the hashes which support variable-length salts.
        * security fix: disabled unix_fallback's "wildcard password" support
          unless explicitly enabled by user.

    CryptContext

        * host_context now dynamically detects which formats
          OS crypt() supports, instead of guessing based on sys.platform.
        * added predefined context for Roundup Issue Tracker database.
        * added CryptContext.verify_and_update() convience method,
          to make it easier to perform both operations at once.
        * *bugfix:* fixed NameError in category+min_verify_time border case
        * apps & hosts modules now use new
          :class:`LazyCryptContext` wrapper class -
          this should speed up initial import,
          and reduce memory by not loading uneeded hashes.

    Documentation

        * greatly expanded documentation on how to use CryptContexts.
        * roughly documented framework for writing & testing
          custom password handlers.
        * various minor improvements.

    Internals

        * added generate_password() convenience method
        * refactored framework for building hash handlers,
          using new mixin-based system.
        * deprecated old handler framework - will remove in 1.5
        * deprecated list_to_bytes & bytes_to_list - not used, will remove in 1.5

    Other

        * password hash api - as part of cleaning up optional attributes
          specification, renamed a number of them to reduce ambiguity:

            - renamed *{xxx}_salt_chars* attributes -> *xxx_salt_size*
            - renamed *salt_charset* -> *salt_chars*
            - old attributes still present, but deprecated - will remove in 1.5

        * password hash api - tightened specifications for salt & rounds parameters,
          added support for hashes w/ no max salt size.

        * improved password hash api conformance tests

        * PyPy compatibility

**1.3.1** (2011-03-28)
======================

    Minor bugfix release.

    * bugfix: replaced "sys.maxsize" reference that was failing under py25
    * bugfix: fixed default_rounds>max_rounds border case that could
      cause ValueError during CryptContext.encrypt()
    * minor documentation changes
    * added instructions for building html documentation from source

**1.3** (2011-03-25)
====================

    First public release.

    * documentation completed
    * 99% unittest coverage
    * some refactoring and lots of bugfixes
    * added support for a number of addtional password schemes:
      bigcrypt, crypt16, sun md5 crypt, nthash, lmhash, oracle10 & 11,
      phpass, sha1, generic hex digests, ldap digests.

**1.2** (2011-01-06)
====================

    .. note::

        For this and all previous versions, PassLib did not exist independantly,
        but as a subpackage of *BPS*, a private & unreleased toolkit library.

    * many bugfixes
    * global registry added
    * transitional release for applications using BPS library.
    * first truly functional release since splitting from BPS library (see below).

    * added support for: des-crypt, bcrypt (via py-bcrypt), postgres, mysql
    * added unit tests

**0.5** (2008-05-10)
====================

    * initial production version
    * consolidated from code scattered across multiple applications
    * MD5-Crypt, SHA256-Crypt, SHA512-Crypt support
