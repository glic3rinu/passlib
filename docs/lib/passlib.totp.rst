=======================================================
:mod:`passlib.totp` -- TOTP / Two Factor Authentication
=======================================================

.. versionadded:: 1.7

.. todo::

    This module is still a work in progress, it's API may change before release.

    Things left:

    * finish unittests (there are a few cases left)
    * write narrative documentation
    * get api documentation formatted better (whether by getting nested sections integrated into TOC,
      or splitting nested sections out into separate sections / pages).
    * probably want a "beta" release of passlib so people can test this a bit before 1.7.0.

    Optional:

    * more verification against other TOTP servers & clients.
    * consider native pyqrcode integration (e.g. a ``to_qrcode()`` method)

API Reference
=============

Common Interface
----------------
.. autoclass:: BaseOTP()

TOTP (Timed-based tokens)
-------------------------
.. autoclass:: TOTP(key=None, format="base32", \*, new=False, \*\*kwds)

Helper Classes
..............

.. autoclass:: TotpToken()

.. autoclass:: TotpMatch()

HOTP (Counter-based tokens)
---------------------------
.. note::

    HOTP is used much less frequently, since it's fragile
    (as it's much easier for the server & client to get out of sync in their token
    count). Unless you have a particular reason, you probably want :class:`TOTP` instead.

.. autoclass:: HOTP(key=None, format="base32", \*, new=False, \*\*kwds)

Helper Classes
..............

.. autoclass:: HotpMatch()

Deviations
==========

* The TOTP Spec [#totpspec]_ includes an potentially offset from the base time (``T0``).
  Passlib omits this (fixing it at ``0``), but so do pretty much all other TOTP implementations.
